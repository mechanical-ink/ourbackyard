        h2(class="lead") Welcome to Ourbackyard. Thank you for stopping by.
      p Ourbackyard is a project that aims to empower local communities by connecting local, non-franchise businesses with the people living in their community. We are often unaware of the wealth of businesses and services in our own backyard. We aim to change that by making it quick and easy to find what you need.&nbsp;
